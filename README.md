# My modded BLV 3D-printer

For starters I build the original BLV printer following the original design.
It worked but because I build the largest version, it didn't print very good..
So, time to do some modifications, a lot of them....  Finally I am now at my BLV printer version 3 ;-)

# <strong>My current setup:</strong> 

# HARDWARE:
* BLV Alu profiles
* Original Duet2Wifi board
* Clone Duex5 board
* Big heated bed
* Orbiter 1.5 extruder
* NF Crazy hotend
* Triple Z-as (SFU1204, MGN rails)
* Accelerator
* 24V Meanwell PSU
