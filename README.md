# My modded BLV 3D-printer

For starters I build the original BLV printer following the original design.
It worked but because I build the largest version, it didn't print very good..
So, time to do some modifications, a lot of them....  Finally I am now at my BLV printer version 3 ;-)

My current setup: 

HARDWARE:
- BLV Alu profiles
- Original Duet2Wifi board
- Clone Duex5 board
- Big heated bed
- Orbiter 1.5 extruder
- NF Crazy hotend
- Triple Z-as (SFU1204, MGN rails)
- Accelerator
- 24V Meanwell PSU

FIRMWARE:
RepRapFirmware for Duet 2 WiFi/Ethernet 3.4.0 (2022-03-15)
Duet WiFi Server Version: 1.26
Duet Web Control 3.4.0
